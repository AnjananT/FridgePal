**Overview**  
FridgePal is a project designed to simplify and enhance the cooking experience using artificial intelligence. By leveraging technologies such as computer vision and convolutional neural networks, FridgePal identifies items in a user's fridge and generates custom recipes based on their preferences, dietary restrictions, and nutritional needs.

**Technologies Used**
**TensorFlow:** Framework useed for building and training the neural network
**OpenCV:** Library used for capturing and processing images from a camera, which are then fed into the TensorFlow model
**OpenAI API:** Used to generate custom recipes using data from AI model
**PostgreSQL:** Databse for storing user data
**Node.js & Express.js:** Backend technologies for RESTful services
**ReactJS:** Frontend library for the user interface. This is where users can select certain allergies to restrict, a calorie amount, and what meal of the day they are having.
